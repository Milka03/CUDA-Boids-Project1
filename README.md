# CUDA-Boids-Project1
Graphic Processors in Computational Applications Project 1 "Shoal of Fish Animation"

To run this project several requirements have to be met:
- Installed CUDA (version 10 or higher)
- Installed graphical libraries: glfw3.lib, glew32s.lib, opengl32.lib
- Paths to Additional Library Directories added to project properties
- Paths to Include Directories of GL and GLFW libraries added to project properties
  
In Visual Studio use Release configuration for debugging, for better visualization of boids' movement.
The fish are shown by arrows (triangles) and are moving according to the flocking behaviour described here: http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/
